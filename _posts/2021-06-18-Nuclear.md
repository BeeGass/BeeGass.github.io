## The Premise

The gaining popularity of electric vehicles within the United States marks an important historical point in how the country should view energy. Since 2011 where plug-in electric vehicles attributed to "one-tenth of one percent of all new light-duty vehicle sales"[^1] and has risen 1000% as of 2019. This should suggest the increasing popularity of switching away from fossil fuels that make up "62% of total U.S. transportation energy use in 2020"[^2]. This popularity shift in automobile energy consumption type along with anticipated legislature to further disincentive the continued use of fossil fuels, on a individual consumer scale, has been met with natural alternatives that could fill in the energy gap that leaving fossil fuels would bring. Those alternatives mostly fall within the umbrella of "renewable". Energy sources like solar, hydro-electric, wind and nuclear are some that fall under that umbrella.


## The Argument

I would like to explore these different energy solutions, specifically solar and nuclear power, and show the pros and cons of each option. My hope is to create a compelling argument as to why nuclear power, and a combination of other renewables other than solar power, is the best solution that benefits the United States and its people while also showing the advantages nuclear power will have over traditional fossil fuel methods.
