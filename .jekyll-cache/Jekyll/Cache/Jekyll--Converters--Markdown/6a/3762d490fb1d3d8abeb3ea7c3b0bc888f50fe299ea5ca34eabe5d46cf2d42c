I"‹<p>I support this website using a combination of jekyll and github pages. Unfortunately, github restricts an immense amount of plugins so a lot of work arounds have to be found, looked into and implemented in order to make seemingly simple task work. This has lead to my use of <a href="https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc">allejoâ€™s excellent table of contents snippet</a>. However, I find the documentation isnâ€™t exactly intuitive and for someone who isnâ€™t used to the world of web development a snippet like this can become confusing. My hope is to show you how to implement allejoâ€™s table of contents (TOC) and how to apply CSS to it.</p>
