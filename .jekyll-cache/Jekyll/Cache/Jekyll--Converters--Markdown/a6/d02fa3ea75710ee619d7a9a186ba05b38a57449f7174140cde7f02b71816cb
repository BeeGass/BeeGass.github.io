I"B<p>I have looked through a decent amount of posts, blogs, and documentation and I have found that very few posts truly share a updated version of how KaTeX can be implemented into jekyll, specifically on github pages. Before I get into my quick explanation of how to do this I would like to redirect you to the <a href="https://codewrites.me/jekyll/katex/blog/2020/08/26/use-katex-gh-pages/">blog</a> post I read which I believe does a good job at explaining the process. My hope is to add to this tutorial and to walk you through in detail how to implement KaTeX yourself.</p>
